  <h1>About Vertical Farming</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Vertical farming is an emerging method of food production in which plants
    grow in an urban, climate-controlled facility, made possible through
    controlled environment agriculture (CEA). CEA uses a software-based
    monitoring and controls system to artificially optimize environmental inputs
    such as lighting, temperature, moisture, and nutritional availability.
  </p>
  <h2>System Controls</h2>
  <p>
    Currently being developed by the Controls, Data, & Automation team, QVFT's
    CEA system comprises a network of sensors that track real-time environmental
    data, including temperature, humidity, water pH, and light levels. These
    sensors feed into a central interface, which then transmits data to a
    computer. The program LabVIEW interprets, analyzes, and records this data,
    which informs its commands to switch equipment (pumps, lights, etc.) ON or
    OFF.
  </p>
  <h2>Crop Selection</h2>
  <p>
    In theory, any crop can be cultivated through vertical farming. However,
    current operations almost exclusively involve small fruits and vegetables
    such as lettuce, kale, spinach, strawberries, and tomatoes. Leafy greens are
    popular choices due to their short growth cycle, high harvestable yield,
    small stature, and compatibility with automation. QVFT will focus
    exclusively on the cultivation of leafy greens in the short term, building
    off of the best current industry practices. In the long term, we plan to
    innovate and experiment with a variety crops, with the goal of improving
    yield, profitability, and sustainability.
  </p>
  <h2>Lighting</h2>
  <p>
    Studies have found that the growth of indoor plants can be manipulated by
    adjustments to the intensity and wavelength of LED lights. QVFT's plant
    science team's research aims to optimize these parameters for each given
    crop, with the ultimate goal of boosting plant productivity.
  </p>
  <h2>Irrigation and Fertigation</h2>
  <p>
    Vertical farming systems are broadly classified as either aeroponic or
    hydroponic, in reference to their mode of nutrient delivery. Aeroponic
    systems2.25based cloth) which allows their roots to dangle inside a basin
    below. Nutrients are dissolved in water (fertigation) and delivered to roots
    via spray nozzles (irrigation). Unused nutrient solution is then collected
    by the basin and recycled. Hydroponic systems, in contrast, cultivate plants
    with their roots suspended directly inside the nutrient solution. LED
    lighting provides energy to facilitate photosynthesis in both types of
    systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of the two, aeroponic systems are considered to be a superior means of water
    conservation and nutrient delivery, as they allow the grower greater control
    over the specific plant nutrient mix. For these reasons, aeroponics will be
    the main focus of QVFT. QVFT's fertigation system will be fully automated
    and integrated within the larger CEA controls system.
  </p>
  <h2>Ventilation</h2>
  <p>
    A CO2 air supplementation system, combined with efficient ventilation, can
    accelerate growth cycles and produce larger, healthier plants and flowers.
    While atmospheric CO2 concentrations hover around 400 PPM, such a system
    could raise ambient levels to 1000 PPM, which is considered optimal for the
    growth of most plants. This system, comprised of CO2 cylinders capped with a
    regulator, can be integrated into QVFTâ€™s CEA system. A tent-like structure
    could be used to isolate the farm from its surroundings and minimize
    unwanted air exchange.
