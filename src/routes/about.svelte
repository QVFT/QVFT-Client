  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    A global trend of increasing concern is the diminishing supply of arable
    land per capita. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    projects that by 2050, this supply will fall to one third of the amount
    available in 1970. This is a combined result of climate change, freshwater
    depletion, urbanization, soil depletion, soil degradation, and a world
    population expected to increase from 7.7 billion (2019) to 9.7 billion
    (2050).
  </p>
  <p>
    An emerging technology which is addressing these concerns is vertical
    farming, a food cultivation method in which crops grow in an indoor, urban,
    climate-controlled facility. This approach is associated with dramatically
    reduced water consumption, slashed transportation costs, massive
    improvements in per-acre land productivity, increased plant productivity,
    and the freedom to cultivate crops in any location, year-round.

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    he Queen's Vertical Farming Team is Canada's first post-secondary
    student-led vertical farming design team. This team allows members of all
    disciplines to engage in a rapidly-developing industry, increase their
    awareness of threats to the global food supply, and gain hands-on experience
    in food cultivation. Program-specific opportunities allow for students to
    gain experience with biochemistry, plant science, computer-aided design,
    computer modelling, data analysis, and systems design.
