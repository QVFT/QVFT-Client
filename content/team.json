    "blurb": "Patrick is a 3rd year biomechanical engineering student with a passion for sustainable technology and environmental issues. Patrick’s lifelong interest in agriculture stems from the many summers spent growing up in rural PEI, the island where his relatives have farmed for generations. This background has also made him aware of the emerging threats faced by agriculture as a whole, from environmental degradation to world population growth. Patrick believes that a business-as-usual approach to agriculture will be impossible to sustain in the coming decades, and that a dramatic, rapid industry overhaul is necessary. Given this, Patrick founded the Queen’s Vertical Farming Team in Summer 2019, while working as a mechanical engineering intern at MCW Custom Energy Solutions (MCW CES). MCW CES is a division of the MCW engineering consulting firm, dedicated to improving the energy efficiency of public buildings through software analysis and HVAC retrofits. This role sharpened Patrick’s expertise in CAD (SolidWorks, Solid Edge), data analysis (Microsoft Excel), material analysis (HAP), and schematic development (Microsoft Visio). Meanwhile, Patrick spent his spare time drafting a business plan for QVFT, which explored the vertical farming concept, depicted a preliminary system architecture, and outlined the team’s purpose, goals, and organizational structure. Once back at school, Patrick and David joined forces and have been working tirelessly ever since to put QVFT’s plans in motion."
